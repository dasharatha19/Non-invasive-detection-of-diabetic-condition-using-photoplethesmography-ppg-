This project presents a non-invasive method for diabetes detection using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals acquired with the MAX30102 sensor. The acquired raw signals were processed through Chebyshev-II filtering, detrending, and envelope detection to remove noise and enhance waveform quality. Key features were extracted from time, frequency, and wavelet domains, including Zero-Crossing Rate, Power Spectral Density, Teager-Kaiser Energy, skewness, and kurtosis, providing a comprehensive representation of PPG dynamics. These features were used to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, achieving an overall accuracy above 90% in distinguishing diabetic from non-diabetic cases. The system demonstrates the potential of AI-driven biomedical signal processing for cost-effective, portable, and real-time healthcare diagnostics, offering a promising alternative to invasive blood-based methods for early diabetes screening
